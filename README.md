In this repository I show to the world the work that I have been doing as a student.

## Analyzer:
A project I did as a student that given an Algoritmo.class input file, runs the algorithm within that class and tries to infer its time complexity comparing it to a given set of algorithms whose complexity I already know.

## Concurrency practices:
In this folder I include some practices I did regarding concurrency.

## JS-Freecodecamp:
Several projects that I had to complete in order to earn my JS freecodecamp certification.

## Parallel architectures:
A base algorithm that is sped up using thread and instruction level parallelism.

## TributePage-FCC:
A web page designed with HTML and CSS that is a tribute to Fernando Alonso's carreer.
